###Overview


Severe weather events can have a negative impact on both the health and economies of communities. Using data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the severe weather events with the largest health and economic impacts can be determined. 

The largest weather event contributors, totaling 95% of the health or economic impact, will be the focus of this analysis. To determine a high level understanding of which events have the largest population health impact, total fatalities and injuries were grouped by event type. For determining the weather events with the largest economic impact, the total property and crop damages were grouped by weather events. Event types with the largest impacts will then be presented.
